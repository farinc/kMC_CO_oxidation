# CO oxidation
Features a number of kMC, mean field, and (soon) ME-MKM kinetic models for CO oxidation following the model of [Tian & Rangarajan, *J. Phys. Chem. C* 2021, 125, 20275](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c04495)

## Model
$$\begin{aligned}
    \mathrm{CO(g)} + \ast &\xrightleftarrows[\gamma]{\alpha} \mathrm{CO}^\ast \\
    \mathrm{O_2(g)} + \ast + \ast &\xrightleftarrows[\delta]{\beta} \mathrm{O}^\ast + \mathrm{O}^\ast \\
    \mathrm{CO}^\ast + \mathrm{O}^\ast &\xrightarrow{k_r} \mathrm{CO_2(g)} + \ast + \ast \\
    \mathrm{CO}^\ast + \ast &\xleftrightharpoons[]{k_\text{hop}} \ast + \mathrm{CO}^\ast \\
    \mathrm{O}^\ast + \ast &\xleftrightharpoons[]{k_\text{hop}} \ast + \mathrm{O}^\ast \\
\end{aligned}$$
Note the differences in arrows. The first two equation are competitive rates whereas the last two diffusion equations follow detailed balance. Hence whole system does not obey detailed balence; particularly because of the reaction. The model only differs from Tian & Rangarajan by the addition of a desorption step for $\mathrm{O}^\ast$. The only real reason for this is providing a model that features ergodicity more realistic conditions. In genereal oxygen binds strongly to most catalyst surfaces so $\delta \ll \beta$ and can be set to zero to restore the model of Tian & Rangarajan. Only $\mathrm{CO}^\ast$ has repuslive lateral interactions in this model. For diffusion, `khop = khop_scale * max(beta, alpha)` mimics the fast-diffusion limit (the default `khop_scale` is 1000, i.e. three orders of magnitude, per the paper).
## kMC Algorithm
The kinetic Monte Carlo method is a rejection-free n-fold (BKL) following the algorithms reviewed by [Chatterjee & Vlachos, *J. Comput.-Aided Mater. Des.* 2007, 14, 253](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10820-006-9042-9) (n-fold method sec. 6.3, linear search sec. 6.1.1, local updates sec. 6.4) on a periodic square lattice. The n-fold works well here because the only interaction is nearest-neighbour, allowing every event rate to belong to one of 20 discrete classes (neighbour counts 0-4). Each kMC step selects a class by linear search over 20 cumulative weights, then a uniform random member — rejection-free, no null events. After an event, only the events within graph distance 2 of the changed sites are re-classified (local update), so the cost per event is O(1), independent of lattice size. Class membership uses swap-with-last lists for O(1) add/remove.

Versus the previous direct-kMC implementation (full rate-matrix rebuild every event, O(N) twice per event): ~4x faster at L=16, ~15x at L=32, ~60x at L=64.

## Development

I would highly recommed to use `git` when making changes to the project. Install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/install/windows) then also [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/). Git acts as like a code journal, it comes in handy when dealing with complicated projects where you should be concise of every detail you have made to the project and to easily reverse changes if they dont work. I would also [setup SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) for your desktop and on the cluster so you can pull/push to the code repository without manaully syncing individual files back and forth.

The manual approach is using the command line interface (CLI) such as CMD, GitBash, etc. This is definitly needed on the cluster.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/farinc/kMC_CO_oxidation
git checkout MFPT
```
Github Desktop can do most of the `git` actions, so on your laptop its a bit easier to get started.

If this is something you would rather not do then skip and download the project as a zip file and carry on.

To actually have the intended python enviroment, download and install `uv` [by Astral](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). If you plan to run this on the cluster then install it there too (its a linux machine) for your user. If you have a conda enviroment active I would deactivate it before setup.

To make use of the Tensor Train Format solver using MALS, use the `tt` group using the `schkit_tt` package.
```sh
uv sync --extra tt 
```
For running the kMC runs in parallel using MPI, then install the `mpi` group. Note that this requires that a MPI runtime is aviable on the system.
```sh
module load openmpi/4.1.2
uv sync --extra mpi 
```
There are two mutually exclusive options for installing the PETSc/SLEPc dependencies needed for ME-MKM support. Note that both install the `mpi` group automatically. When using the native option, make sure the `PETSC_DIR` and `SLEPC_DIR` enviroment variables are set before hand alongside mpi runtime.

**You must run the two `uv sync` calls below separately, one after the other -- do not pass both extras in a single `uv sync` call.** `petsc4py` and `slepc4py` both build with `--no-build-isolation`, and `slepc4py`'s build needs `petsc4py` to already be installed; uv builds no-build-isolation packages within a single `uv sync` concurrently, so requesting both extras at once races the two builds and `slepc4py` fails to find `petsc4py`'s headers. Splitting into two sequential syncs guarantees `petsc4py` is fully installed before `slepc4py`'s build starts.

```sh
# Option 1: link against a PETSc/SLEPc that already exists on the system
# (e.g. a cluster module, or system packages). Set PETSC_DIR/SLEPC_DIR first.
module load gcc/10.3.0 petsc/3.25.3-real slepc/3.25.1-real openmpi/4.1.2 cmake/3.28.4
UV_LOCK_TIMEOUT=600 uv sync --extra native-petsc -v && uv sync --extra native-slepc -v
```
```sh
# Option 2: build PETSc/SLEPc from source via the PyPI `petsc`/`slepc`
# packages; no external install needed, but the first sync compiles
# PETSc/SLEPc, which is slow.
UV_LOCK_TIMEOUT=1200 uv sync --extra source-petsc && uv sync --extra source-slepc
```
Once that done your ready to code! IDE's and the code editor VS Code is aware of python enivroments and will activate them for you to run files and code hints related to the dependencies. Otherwise, use `source .venv/bin/activate` on your linux machine/Git Bash. There probably a way to do this in other terminals...

## Usage
```sh
uv run python -m sweeps.linear                 # default sweep: L=16, beta 0..10 s^{-1}, t_max 30 s
uv run python -m sweeps.linear --kmc-L 24 --out case1

uv run pytest                                  # test suite for development purposes
```

Both `sweeps/linear.py` and `sweeps/mpi.py` run up to **three independent
phases** and write their output files (default prefix `co_oxidation`):

- **kMC sweep** (`--no-kmc` to skip) &rarr; `{out}_kmc_sweep.csv`: per-beta kMC
  steady coverages from the empty and CO-covered starts. When ME-MKM is on,
  its steady coverages (`memkm_empty/co/o`) and the basin-weight ratio
  `log10 pi(A)/pi(B)` (`log_ratio`) are attached to the same file.
- **ME-MKM coexistence** (`--memkm`/`--no-memkm`; **off by default** in
  `sweeps/linear.py` -- even a small tile is too slow for a laptop, **on by
  default** in `sweeps/mpi.py`) &rarr; `{out}_coexistence.csv`: for each
  beta\* where `log_ratio` changes sign (Brent-refined), the slow
  eigenvalues, the committor-based basin transition rates `k_AB`, `k_BA`, the
  reactive flux, and two-state-kinetics diagnostics. Needs the
  `native-petsc`+`native-slepc` or `source-petsc`+`source-slepc` extras.
- **Mean field** (`--no-meanfield` to skip) &rarr; `{out}_meanfield.csv`: the
  MF-MK and Ea-MK steady-state branches, computed on a filled-in beta grid that
  still passes through every sweep beta (`--meanfield-beta-step` sets the
  fill-in spacing) so the smooth bifurcation curves line up with the kMC /
  ME-MKM sample points.

Note that `sweeps/linear.py` remains available for a plain single-core run. If done on a laptop limit the sweep to a few beta cause the runs are not run in parallel and take considerable time.

### Running on an HPC cluster

`sweeps/mpi.py` runs the kMC `(beta, (empty, full))` cases round-robin across
MPI ranks (gathered on rank 0), then runs the ME-MKM / SLEPc coexistence
analysis *collectively* -- all ranks cooperate on each beta's distributed
generator, one beta at a time. Two submit scripts are provided:
```sh
qsub submit_kmc_sge.sh --kmc-L 24 --out case1                  # kMC sweep
qsub submit_coexistence_sge.sh --memkm-sites 12 --out big      # + coexistence
```
Everything after the script name is forwarded to `sweeps/mpi.py` (including any
`-eps_*`/`-st_*` PETSc/SLEPc runtime options). The cluster build should include
MUMPS (`--download-mumps`); see the comments in `submit_coexistence_sge.sh`.

## Using as a Dependency
Since this is a `uv` hybrid project and library you can use this as a dependency in other projects:
```sh
uv init
uv add "co_oxidation @ git+https://github.com/farinc/CO-Oxidation.git"
``` 
A few examples:

```python
# kMC: run one trajectory at a given O2 impingement rate beta
from co_oxidation.kmc import KMCParams, run_kmc

result = run_kmc(beta=5.0, init="empty", params=KMCParams(L=16))
print(result.steady_co, result.steady_o)
```

```python
# Mean field: steady-state branches over a beta range
from co_oxidation.meanfield import steady_states, branches

state = steady_states(beta=5.0)              # single beta
curves = branches(betas=[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10])  # full bifurcation sweep
```

```python
# ME-MKM needs the some `petsc` and `slepc` aviable.
from me_mkm import TileSettings
from co_oxidation.memkm import generate_model, CoexistencePipeline

tile = TileSettings.smallest_valid_square(8, True)  # 8-site ME-MKM tile
pipeline = CoexistencePipeline(tile)
log_ratio = pipeline.basin_log_ratio(beta=5.0)       # log10 pi(A)/pi(B)
```
