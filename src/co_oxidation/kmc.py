"""
Rejection-free n-fold (BKL) kinetic Monte Carlo for CO oxidation on a periodic
square lattice, after Tian & Rangarajan (J. Phys. Chem. C 2021, 125, 20275).

Model (site states: 0 = empty, 1 = CO*, 2 = O*):

    CO(g) + *      -> CO*            rate  alpha
    CO*            -> CO(g) + *      rate  gamma * exp(+n*eps/RT)
    O2(g) + 2*     -> O* + O*        rate  beta          (adjacent empty pair)
    O* + O*        -> O2(g) + 2*     rate  delta         
    CO* + O*       -> CO2(g) + 2*    rate  kr * exp(+n*eps/RT)
    CO* + *        -> * + CO*        rate  khop * exp(-dn*eps/2RT)   (NN hop)
    O*  + *        -> * + O*         rate  khop

Here n is the number of CO nearest neighbours of the CO* involved, and eps > 0
is the CO-CO nearest-neighbour repulsion. Barriers follow BEP relations with
omega = 1 for desorption and reaction and omega = 1/2 for hops. For a hop,
dn = n_final - n_initial, and the moving CO is excluded from the destination
neighbour count. That exclusion fixes a self-counting bias in the earlier
direct-kMC script and restores detailed balance for diffusion.

The algorithm is the n-fold method described by Chatterjee & Vlachos
(J. Comput.-Aided Mater. Des. 2007, 14, 253, section 6.3). Every event 
belongs to one of 20 rate classes (see the class layout below). A step 
picks a class by linear search over the 20 cumulative class weights 
(section 6.1.1), then picks a random member of that class. Every attempt 
fires, so there are no null events. After an event only the events 
within graph distance 2 of the changed sites are looked at again, 
which makes the cost per event independent of lattice size.

Event encoding: event id = site*J_MAX + j, with per-site slots

    j=0 CO ads, j=1 CO des, j=2,3 O2 ads right/down, j=4,5 rxn right/down,
    j=6,7 CO hop across the right/down bond, j=8,9 O hop right/down,
    j=10,11 O2 des right/down.

Pair events live on the right or down bond of a site, so each bond appears
exactly once. A hop slot is active whenever one end of the bond holds the
mobile species and the other end is empty. The rate depends on which end
the adsorbate sits on, and _classify works that out.

# An n-fold class groups every event on the lattice that currently has the
# same rate (Bortz, Kalos and Lebowitz). That grouping is possible here
# because the only lateral interaction is the nearest-neighbour CO-CO pair
# term. A rate can then depend on the configuration only through an integer
# CO neighbour count, so the full rate spectrum collapses to the 20 discrete
# values below. The function _classify maps an event to its class, and a kMC 
# step only searches 20 cumulative class weights instead of all N*10 per-site 
# rates.
#
# The ranges: n runs 0..4 for desorption. For a hop, both ends of the
# bond are excluded from the counts, because the destination is empty and
# the mover must not count itself there. Each end then sees at most 3 CO,
# so dn runs -3..+3. Reaction never actually reaches n = 4 either, since
# one neighbour of the CO is its O partner. Slots 0..4 are allocated anyway
